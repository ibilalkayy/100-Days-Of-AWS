# AWS Projects Repository

Welcome to my AWS Projects Repository! In this repository, I will be sharing a collection of projects that showcase the different AWS services and their capabilities. Each project will be a separate folder in the repository and contain all the necessary files, including code, configuration files, and documentation.

# Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you will need an AWS account and some basic knowledge of AWS services. Each project folder contains detailed instructions on how to set up the project and deploy it to AWS.
