# **Go AWS S3 File Uploader**

This project demonstrates a simple application that uses Go programming language and the AWS SDK for Go to upload files to an Amazon S3 bucket. It is aimed at beginners and is a great way to familiarize yourself with using AWS and Go together.

## **Prerequisites**

Before you start, make sure you have the following set up:

- Go installed on your machine.
- An active AWS account and access to an S3 bucket.
- AWS CLI installed and correctly configured with your AWS credentials.
- AWS SDK for Go installed in your Go workspace.

For detailed setup instructions, refer to our comprehensive setup guide.

## **Getting Started**

The program operates in several steps:

- Importing necessary Go and AWS SDK packages.
- Loading AWS SDK configuration.
- Creating an S3 client.
- Uploading a file to your specified S3 bucket.
- Handling any errors that might occur during the upload process.
- To use the program, substitute the placeholders in the code with your actual AWS region, bucket name, and filename. The file you want to upload should be in the same directory as your Go program.
